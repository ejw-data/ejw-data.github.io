&lt;p&gt;My last article was a bit long so hopefully this one is more concise.  Although this article is an important topic - it’s about personal growth.  Everything from this past year where I think I have expanded my current skills or identified a potential preference that brings joy to myself.  Below is a short list of some of my key findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Long term interest:  Detailed Analytics&lt;/code&gt;:   Recently, I had an opportunity to work on a project where the type of work varied drastically.  Sometimes I would be doing analytics, somtimes I would be doing collaborative work, and other times I might monitoring a system looking for failures that needed escalated.  What I realized is that I find great comfort doing detailed analytics work.  It became obvious that I do not get tired or bored doing this work.  I was also very proud of my accomplishments and found it easy to push to get the most value out of each project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Distancing myself from busy-body work&lt;/code&gt;:  I have always been able to adapt to almost any situation and have learned to tolerate aspects of the situation that I find frustrating, but in 2022 I realized that I have always hated being bombarded with requests.  Now, this might sound like a normal expections of a job but I am referring to a role where a new request comes in every few minutes that needs attention - sort of the customer service type role but can also be found in technical roles.  I had a role where I would get an email, slack message, and app alert from each source every couple minutes and I needed to immediately respond and on top of that I needed to monitor several dashboards on a very frequent basis.  I could do it all but this would be constant for hours and realized that my introverted self just became exhausted with this work.  This type of work in limited bursts is fine but not 40% of my work hours for a year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OOP and Simulations&lt;/code&gt;:  I really enjoyed some of my coding projects this past year.  My favorite and often most challenging study was expanding my experience with making object oriented programs which often centered around building simulations.  I motivation was a YouTube video about Decision Science - similar to data science but with more emphasis on evaluating what is the value of ideas to the organization.  After looking at the open source tools for simulation, I realized that there was an incredible amount of potential to explore dynamic problems that often machine learning can not capture very effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SQL Projects&lt;/code&gt;:  I was finally able to write Advanced SQL off my todo list.  I knew fundamental concepts but never had to do a full ETL project.  In total I did about three projects that started with messy data and went through all the steps to get it into a cloud or local database.  Afterwards, I kept adding new data to it and checking to see if the database function well and was easy to access the information.  After a handful of projects, I think the only topic still on my SQL todo list is to do a project where I use recursive CTE.  I have learned about them but never really needed to incorporate them into a project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I'm decent with Tableau&lt;/code&gt;:  I always thought I was not very good with Tableau but it turns out that I have very similar capabilities as those who use Tableau on a regular basis.  It was a bit shocking because I have always discounted this skill.  I also taught a 1.5 hour class on the subject this year when an instructor was unable to make it to the class.  I did pretty good I think for only discussing everything from memory and only 30 minutes advance notice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I'm typically a good listener&lt;/code&gt;:  This is a trait that I realized that &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; many people have within the data science field.  Too many times this past year, I witnessed people answering questions that were never asked or going on tangents.  I think this is why I find mentoring others be very natural.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Project Management&lt;/code&gt;: It seems as if project management is my de facto role.  When in a group I seem to be the one that plans out the steps and wants to do a work breakdown structure.  Breaking down projects in small components and managing their execution seems like the obvious first step.  What do other people do?  My experience is that confusion is the alternative but maybe there are ways - I guess it works for Jazz musicians.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By September 2022, I had begun distributing my resume to potential employers.  It was somewhat of an odd experience - partially because I had not truly done an interview since 2018 and partially because everything is now performed online.  I had sent out resumes in February 2020, as I was finishing my data science certificate program at Northwestern, but everything was shutting down due to COVID by the next month and all hiring just stopped.  I think I had applied for 20 positions at that time.  This time I applied for only 8 positions but each one was something that I thought would be a very good fit and happily had 4 positive responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial interviews were very similar to my past interviews.  Most of them were with human resources personnel over the phone and was just a general discussion about my interests and background.  I find these discussions to be very beneficial since I have a chance to ask about the ambiguous aspects of the job posting; although, many times I am told that only the hiring manager can provide details.  In general, I was able to get a sense of what the job is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the four initial phone interviews, I went on to do two second round interviews and I rejected one offer for a second interview and I was not selected for another second round interview.  Luckily, my two favorite options were interested in me.  The interview that I turned down was due to concerns that the job would have a very limited use of modern tools and that the actual job did not match the job posting.  The second interview and third interviews were with the hiring manager and then with multiple coworkers.  After all the interviews, it took around 6 weeks to get a response since I was the first candidate interviewed for both positions.  Both companies made offers at about the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What differed from my past experiences was that neither company offered for me to visit the office and talk to the team about what they do and how they do it.  This was discussed during the second and third interviews but in a very time constrained manner.  I asked additional questions about what to expect after I was told I would get an offer and I did get reasonable answers but much of it was deferred to later because I was told that I would receive two to six months of training before being completely onboarded.  Everyone seemed very likeable and positive about their roles and the hybrid work schedule was said to be working well.  I have had concerns about onboarding with most people working from home - it seems like this would cause problems in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of receiving an offer was very brief compared to past experiences and was completely negotiated by the recruiter and not the hiring manager.  Shortly after my followup questions, I received a verbal offer from the recruiter and was immediatly asked to discuss salary.  This was actually an unplanned phone call and the recruiter was a bit abrupt when outlining the salary and benefits.  I asked for a small bump in salary because I knew the basics of the other offer I would be getting but I had not received anything in writing yet.  The recruiter contacted me the next day with a final offer and gave me roughly five days to make a decision.  I thought this was a bit fast considering I had waited six weeks for their interview process to finish. After a couple days, I accepted the offer and received a confirmation from the recruiter but that was actually the last I ever heard from that person.  This was a bit odd because they entered a start date that I had not agreed upon and all documentation from that point forward was from an automated system.  In total, I think the entire process occurred during one work week - from followup questions to offer to acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in summary, the process was much less personal than my past experiences.  Everything was done online and often details were omitted.  Upon follow messages, some clarity was provided but it required asking very detailed questions to get the necessary information.  The one change I would make now is to push for more clarity regarding their onboarding process.  In the end, I really liked the company as a whole but the onboarding process and the long-term details for my particular role were not explained well.  Within my first few weeks, I realized what seemed like very manageable tasks I had done routinely in the past were part of a time consuming, poorly designed workflow and the training was not very good either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first and only time in my career, I was not able to speed through onboarding and didn’t really see how I would thrive in this environment - it seemed like I would spend all my time asking questions about what I would consider standard operating procedures and the responses often resulted in vague and misleading answers.  After multiple discussions with my coworkers and verifying that everything was going according to plan with my manager, I began to weigh the benefits of continuing at that role.  I realized that even after I learned the core information for the position, I would still be working within a frustrating workflow.  So after only six weeks on the job, I resigned.  I’m probably lucky that the initial training did not go well - by the fourth week, I was designing my own work breakdown structure (WBS) which helped me understand what I should expect after several months on the job and it was a bit disheartening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say that I have benefitted from the work from home experiences of the past few years.  By saving two hours each day on commuting and being able to utilize my time at home very effectively, I have been able to add significant time developing data skills.  With my schedule from before the pandemic, I don’t know if I could have had enough time or energy to be able to include meaningful learning.  So I give strong praise for work at home for its ability to support independent research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side prior to the pandemic, I would often go to meetup.com meetings hosted in downtown Chicago about python, machine learning, and database applications.  These seminars were grade and they continue online but the part that could not be duplicated is the wisdom sharing and battle stories tha were shared among the guests at the in-person meetings.  I learned so much from hearing about the experiences people had and it gave me a lot of perspective about what this career included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really synpathsize with employers now.  On one hand people can become better employees through easier access to technical training.  On the other hand, the interpersonal discussions provided a context that helped me plan my future career.  I could see everyone going back to full time in the office; although not ideal, but I definitely don’t think work from home all the time is good for professional development and collaborative work.  I tend to think that working several days from the office and but also having several days where one can work from home to be very nice compromise.&lt;br /&gt;

By mid-2021, I had completed my data science certificate program at Northwestern University, two rotations as a teaching assistant with the same program, 4 data science online classes, and multiple self-study projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between my full time job at Northwestern and my professional development, my schedule was typically booked between 6am to 10pm everyday except for Sunday.  A slow weeks was 90 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A challenge to this schedule was that I switched between technologies multiple times each day.  My job at Northwestern was not a technical position but I did whatever was needed.  Aince I could code, there were many tasks that had been done manually but in cases where a quick turnaround was needed then I would often automate the task.  Switching technologies and being busy with the certificate program always made me feel that I was not advancing my skills - as soon as I would be getting into the zone with one technology it was time for me to move to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, I started to work remotely doing several technology projects on a gig-like situation.  It was kind of a odd situation but it worked well for both of us since we both needed some flexibility in our schedules.  I wanted to continue teaching at the certificate program and my Northwestern schedule was not going to accomodate my schedule well and I was scheduled for some foot surgery where I would be off my feet for weeks and have some physical therapy afterwards.  I also wanted to see family for a few weeks - my parents are older and had only been able to see them once during the two years of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a great experience so far.  My schedule is still busy but I have been able to go more indepth with technologies and I feel that my fluency when coding in python, sql, javascript and other languages has gotten much better.  I have also become a better teaching assistant because I went back to the lessons and modified them and polished up some of my terminology and explanations.  I definitely had a feeling of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/code&gt; prior to my changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at my six month checkpoint, I feel that I am ready to explore more areas of the data science field.  The skills of the trade are well within my grasp and now I am working more on the art form of the trade.  My current personal goals are to expand my experiences with simulations, machine learning algorithms, time series analysis, and geospacial analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I should have probabably made this jump about two years ago.  Working that schedule did not really let me focus and process the meaning of what I was learning.  The one truly wise decision I made was working as a data science teaching assistant.  The experience of reading different styles of coding and explaining concepts in different ways has helped develop a strong foundation.  Now I just need some real world case studies to apply these tools to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Erin Wills</name><email>ejw.data@gmail.com</email></author><category term="articles" /><summary type="html">I made some changes in early 2022 after realizing in 2021 that my schedule was just not productive with my future interests.

&lt;p&gt;So I would say that I have been developing my data science knowledge-base since the summer of 2019.  Around that time, I took several Standford University online classes and started a six month Northwestern University Data Science Certificate Program and since Spring 2020 I have been a data science teaching assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I carefully decided to commit my time and effort of this transition after attending nearly weekly meetup.com meetings for a year.  After talking to members of the Python and PostgreSQL meetups and attending some industry based seminars from MATTER, I decided this was a career move I would really like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s odd to say this but a benefit of the pandemic was the opening up of my schedule so that my days were no longer 10 to 12 hours at my primary employer.  I often had 2 hours of commuting time and multiple hours of random meetings that I would get pulled into.  Due to the pandemic, I could add 3-4 hours daily for professional development.  I have more information about this in my post “Work Schedules” but over the past two years I have been able to fit into my schedule over 30 hours per week related to data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I announced in June 2021 that I would leave my Northwestern job in December 2021.  In 2021, I was actually working more hours dedicated to my role at the data science bootcamp and professional development than I was doing at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Erin Wills</name><email>ejw.data@gmail.com</email></author><category term="articles" /><summary type="html">So I would say that I have been developing my data science knowledge-base since the summer of 2019.

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase Yield (Product Output)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increrase Efficiency (Decrease Cost)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;OR the combination of the two for a blockbuster project.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took great comfort in this philosophy when working on projects and some mild anxiousness if I was working on projects that had low value.  Let’s be honest about it - you can calculate what the value of an employee is and whether they are making or losing money for a company (that is more or less true; there are some caveats to this idea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perspective is often what drives my thoughts when I consider data projects.  What value is in the analysis?  If it has low potential value then why work on it unless that work can be used else where later for high value projects.  I guess I would say that I work on projects not because I want to try new things but because I want to generate value.  I could go on about this subject but I will hold off.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Erin Wills</name><email>ejw.data@gmail.com</email></author><category term="articles" /><summary type="html">As an engineer or in any role that I have had, I always looked at my job as doing two different tasks: Increase Yield (Product Output) Increrase Efficiency (Decrease Cost) OR the combination of the two for a blockbuster project.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/blog/trend.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/blog/trend.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Design Principles</title><link href="/articles/2022-06-02-design/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Design Principles" /><published>2022-06-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-12T03:55:17-05:00</updated><id>/articles/design</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/2022-06-02-design/">&lt;p&gt;I add this equation to my frontpage because it was used at a seminar during my junior year in college by a guest lecturer who was originally from DOW Chemical.

&lt;p&gt;Well this is a difficult question.  I think if I really knew I would have been doing that job years ago.  For me, I originally went into chemical engineering because I enjoyed the types of problems I was presented and over time I used more and more technology.  It’s quite amazing to me when I think about how I went from a rural area with little internet and computer needs to programming Distributed Control Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I wanted to do something a bit different than working in chemical facilities.  I did have strong opinions about how people are trained in technical areas and thought I could go into education technology to improve post-secondary and professional development experiences.  I realized pretty quickly that there are not many applications of technology really being used in education that improves the experience and most education providers don’t invest much money in development of new revolutionary tools.  If I wanted to do that then it is better to just develop technology in my free time and eventually create a company because its a tough industry and most companies want to generate revenue with the least amount of risk.  I continue to think about this topic.  It was probably my driving reason for working for a education technology company and their bootcamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where am I now on this subject?  I’m pretty open to most industries.  I can not say I have a specific field that is ideal.  I probably lean toward geospacial analysis because it is just a topic that seems to provide so many interesting answers and generates interesting questions - it’s almost like its a subject that is never brought up by anyone.  I also seem to enjoy data extraction and cleaning much more than most people.  It makes me feel a bit odd - it’s also a subject that many don’t like but I find it natural to explore data and try to find that bit that has been overlooked and then see what changes when models are run on that data.  I think this must be a habit from working with chemical process data that was so messy that when you finally found that trend that explained why things work the way they do and you can generate extra margin from it - that was a great feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Erin Wills</name><email>ejw.data@gmail.com</email></author><category term="articles" /><summary type="html">Well this is a difficult question.

It’s quite amazing to me when I think about how I went from a rural area with little internet and computer needs to programming Distributed Control Systems.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/blog/collaboration.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/blog/collaboration.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Inspirations</title><link href="/articles/2022-06-01-inspirations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Inspirations" /><published>2022-06-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-11T04:03:16-05:00</updated><id>/articles/inspirations</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/2022-06-01-inspirations/">&lt;p&gt;What I am about to write should be Part II of my Philosophy post because it had a pretty profound affect on how I thought about my career.&lt;br /&gt;
If my memory serves me, all this occurred in one week near the beginning of my senior year at Purdue University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a lecture about engineering design, the instructor talked about a conference seminar from the past year where the speaker proposed that design could be described by one equation.  Essentially, what he wrote up on the dry erease board was the probability density function from  negative infinity to positive infinity.  He asked the class to explain the equation and after a couple feeble attempts and one comical attempt he continued to explain my paraphrased version of it:&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A designer, whether engineer or other trade, considers all the potential negative outcomes related to a problem they are trying to solve.  All outcomes are expressed in this equation and the quality of your design is based on how many and which outcomes your design can accomodate.  The more circumstances, as in the greater percent of the area under the curve, that can be addressed then the better the design but it is highly unlikely you will solve all the issues as almost all designs come with tradeoffs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just truly impressed with this seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other event that week was a seminar with former Dow Chemical CEO, Paul Oreffice.  Now, his history as CEO is a bit controversial due to the companies practices in the 1970’s related to chemicals sold to the US Army and other practices but he had an incredible story about his early career.  It was a long story but the gist of it was something like:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Be smart with how you view risk.  It is something you will have to become astute with managing but if it truly doesn't have significant reprecussions as in harm or moral conflicts then there is not much preventing you for going for it.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was after he told some stories about risks he took that could have gone either way but in the end worked out for him or had negligible impact but provided him great experience for tasks he later faced.  With that all being said, this also prompted several questions about ethical business practices which he provided a answer to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have an honorable mention memory from that week.  My controls class began each lecture from the first week to the last week with listing the 5 most important parts to an engineer’s job.  Number one was the only emphasized selection every time and the topic was &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;/code&gt;.  The lecture I remember the most was about the tragedy that occured at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India in 1984.  A preventible accident occurred where a toxic gas cloud was released and passed over a highly populated, incredibly poor area just outside the facility gates.  Thousands of people died immediately and many more over the weeks afterwards.  I remembered this discussion because I had worked with an engineer who worked at Union Carbide and he had talked about how this ethical issue had such an incredible effect on the company because US employees were so upset and ashamed something like this could happen that employees began quitting the company.  The company lost so much talent that employees knew it was a sinking ship.  The dynamics of this situation are interesting and the role of leadership and the lack of it in this scenario are worht studying.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Erin Wills</name><email>ejw.data@gmail.com</email></author><category term="articles" /><summary type="html">What I am about to write should be Part II of my Philosophy post because it had a pretty profound affect on how I thought about my career.

&lt;p&gt;I think I can say I have had a very broad range of experiences thus far in my career but the common theme is that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I have always done a little bit of everything at the places I have worked&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
This is not exactly what I had envisioned when coming out of college - I thought I would become a specialist but due to the nature of what was needed, I shifted roles every couple months and adapted to new technologies so by default I think that makes me a generalist.  I’m beginning to doubt that thought after meeting multiple data scientiests and am starting to think I would fit well in a data career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons I think I would fit well in this field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Science incorporates a broad range of technologies that are always changing.  My background largely supports the foundations.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Engineering background with stats, math, and computer science technical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of Web Development Technologies which make database, visualization, and webscraping tasks much easier.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Comfortable working with large amounts of data including messy data in multiple formats and technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Consistently learning new technologies.  Let’s be honest, much of the work is selecting the right technology for the specific neeed.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;article&lt;/code&gt; about how technolgies can be interchangeable - pandas, sql, js, etc.  its about moving data around&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I have now been a Data Science teaching assistant for about 2 years and have worked with multiple instructors.  I feel that I am pretty competent in many of the areas and what I don’t know, I can figure out quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working well with others is critical to satisfying a clients needs and effectively executing a complex project.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Truly enjoy developing projects from conceptualization to execution and process improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strong communication, project management and collaboration skills&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I’m honest, straight-forward, non-adversarial, optimistic, and can indulge people when needed and ignore people when necessary.  So for those difficult to work with people, I greatly disappoint them by not stoking any fires.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The melding of technologies is necessary to truly accomplish most tasks. Individual skills are great but interrelationship among them is where money can be made.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Okay, so this is an area where I think I can really excel. Python (SQLAlchemy, Flask, Pandas, graphing libraries, ML Libraries, etc), SQL, Databases, R, Web Technologies, Tableau, etc.  These are tools that can be used together to do some pretty useful and automated tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I am looking to become more profiecient in Discrete Event Simulations and incorporating my data skills.  I enjoy combining theoretical calculations, modeling process data, and considering hypothetical situations.  It’s truly going back to my favorite engineering experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I think I could sucessfully move between analyst, visualization, machine learning, and data organization tasks quite readily.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;My greatest challenge right now is to stay up-to-date with new technology and practical skills.  Working with at a company with a good technology stack and data culture would elevate my compencies.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Do it all for you systems” are a great concept but one solution rarely works for most situations so adapting technology should be expected.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I worked on a project where the client really wanted to use Microsoft Sharepoint and some of their work could be implemented on that system but parts of it could have been done much better and faster with other tools.  I setup the tools and got the other tasks to work and I only hope someone maintained it after I left.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
