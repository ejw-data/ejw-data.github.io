      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>I must say that I think in terms of project management.  I split most types of work I do into categories 
          and each one I manage independently.  I have enjoyed this philosophy for many years since I can always 
          have multiple projects occurring at any given time.
      </p>  
      <p>I may start a project in January with full knowledge 
          that I will not do very much on it until June but the resource assessment, the milestones, the key performance 
          indicators, bottleneck troubleshooting, and time restraints are part of the planning from the very beginning. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Recently, I have been reading about Agile methodologies including Kanban and Scrum and comparing these methods 
          to my experiences with Six Sigma and other processes like Stage Gate methods.

                <p>Too many emails; no one opened them; mass confusion ensued.  That was the problem.  In response, I created an 
                    announcement email that I sent weekly providing updates about upcoming events with links and forms for additional
                    information and to sign-up.</p> 
                <p>Other changes were also implemented.  For example, a common request was for volunteers, but students were hesitant to
                    join without knowing the time commitment involved.  In response, all sign-up forms began including an agenda with expectations and 
                    the contact information of the project leader.  This simple change greatly impacted the responses.</p>
                <p>Another common request was for students to change bad behaviors - the "don't do this anymore" request.  As it turned out,
                    most students did not have the prior knowledge to know what they should do.  So templates, checklists, and other simple notifications 
                    were used to bridge the gap and improve conditions.</p>
                <p>All these responses were integrated into the weekly emails.

                <p>There are many stereotypes about universities but I would say that no one would consider the education program 
                    as idle.  The image below is a planning document that I used to schedule events 
                    for the summer programs and the document provided did not include two events that normally occurred each year.  Each
                    summer I organized 6 programs - Research Experience for Undergraduates, Research Experience for Teachers, Young Scholars
                    (high school students), Adventures in STEM (middle school all-female camp), MITES/eVol (middle school diversity camp),
                    4-H Power Camp (rural middle school student camp) - and multiple smaller events for other groups.</p>
                <p>The typical summer schedule involved a new program starting each Monday of June and a smaller event scheduled for 
                    each week of July.  Some of the smaller events were high school students touring labs (30-60 kids) and a poster symposium 
                    for all summer students performing research (60-90 students).  As these events occurred, so did the preparation for the
                    fall semester which included after-school programs, a seminar series, graduate student council activities, and preparation 
                    for an NSF/DOE funding review.

                <p>For all my projects, I estimated the hours needed to complete the task, the cost of labor, and the cost of
                    materials.  These were the minimal scoping requirements.</p>
                <p>After initiating a project I tracked the previous metrics, which often involved more 
                    than 40 students per semester supporting events.  I also reviewed all expenses on the monthly reports and verified appropriate account
                    allocation and tracked that federally required spending was on target to meet all metrics.

                <p>As part of the effort to reduce emails, I began posting jobs and internships on an internal network wiki and 
                    advertising the openings through the weekly email announcement.  This information incentivized the students to 
                    read through the emails.  It was also beneficial for me to be involved since I was also tracking all the student
                    involvement.  
                </p>
                <p>In a typical year, there would be around 30 graduate interns and 10 undergraduate interns working in the power and 
                    energy sector.  About 40% of graduate students completed internships and about 25% of undergraduates also completed
                    internships.  Although, it should also be noted that about another 25% of undergraduates worked as undergraduate
                    researchers each summer.

                    manager was actually the person that did most of the preparation work.  My role was to help explain the process to the
                    students, provide an orientation seminar each fall, coordinate student exit processes with the department, and review the

                    events interacting with over 12,000 people in four years.  The largest contributers were pre-college 
                    education outreach (6,700 attendees), student seminars and professional development (4,700 attendees), and 
                    university recruitment (600 attendees).  The numbers above are very representative since I documented each 
                    events attendance.  Most likely the numbers would be several thousand larger if events like graduate student
                    field trips, software training events, and other professional development were included in the above numbers.</p>

                    field trips, performing research content, evaluating recruitment needs and collecting data, developing new
                    collaborations, and researching special projects.

                <p>One of the busiest parts of the year was between mid-October and mid-November of each year.  This was the time when 
                    preparations for an NSF research center review (for continued funding) was in full swing.  This event brought in 
                    many of the members of the research center - 50+ industry members, 20+ faculty, 120+ graduate student researchers, 
                    50+ undergraduate researchers, 4 deans, and members of the scientific advisory board.</p>
                <p>Typically organized like a conference and run by students, the two day event had seminars, lab tours, poster sessions,
                    guest speakers, and the ever important meals (ask any student).  My role was unofficial.  I did not book the hotel 
                    meeting rooms nor arrange the food.  I did not collect abstracts or posters or print materials.  I provided advice and
                    reviews of the work each committee was performing - I provided real-time feedback from an organizational perspective.</p>

                <p>About once a year, CURENT would host a workshop or conference.  Prior to these events, I would help with the logistics
                    and website preparation.  These events needed a place to provide registration information, event agendas, event
                    presentations, and other logistics.  For multiple events, I created the website, registration forms, and email
                    notifications.  Below is an example of one of the websites and a HTML-based email notification.

                <p>Throughout the year I would record data about new students and create summaries.  Early each spring I would 
                    estimate the student enrollment to determine how effective the fall recruitment campaign had been and to
                    determine if any corrective actions could be done prior to the fall semester.  Common events included
                    the SHPE Conference, NSBE Conference, GEM Grad events, TLSAMP events, Breakfast for Champions (high school event), 
                    and visits to HBCUs.

                <p>I would also research benchmarks to compare the university program to other organizations and best practices
                    that could be incorporated into training or processes at the university.  Determining benchmarks was
                    particularly difficult considering most universities do not release information about specific departments or
                    specialty programs.

                    is more in line with theories of andragogy.  The IMPACT Program was designed as a way for students to document their non-technical
                    skills through the activities that they do on a daily basis.  My role was to set most of the requirements and provide a tool 
                    that aids the students in tracking their data.</p>

                      researcher seminar, and two professional development seminars.  My role was to organize the professional 
                      development seminars, advertise the events, and handle all logistics related to the speakers.  The students
                      and industry relations staff each submitted their speaker information and schedule.</p>

                      A seminar would typically have at least 35 student attendees but would often have over 55 attendees.  About

                      2015, I hosted the poster session by organizing the 5+ research groups.  This involved collecting the poster
                      information (title, author, research group), arranging stands and display boards, and having a symposium guide
                      printed.  In 2016, the event was hosted again at CURENT but my summer undergrad worker used my templates and

                  <p>With more than half of the past REU students still in college, the most recent 
                      graduates had 41% going to graduate school, 41% going to industry, and 18% with unknown status.  The summer 
                      undergraduate program had similar results.  The first two cohorts had under 15% of students attending
                      graduate school, but since changing processes cohort 3 and cohort 4 had about 50% of the students going to grad
                      school. The past two cohorts (5,6) are unknown their success since most of the students are still working
                      on their BS.     
                  </p>
                  <p>The application process also showed improvements.  The first few year's applications had about 24 highly 
                      qualified candidates annually but those candidates were only 13% female and less than 29% under-represented 
                      minorities.  In 2017, there were 43 highly qualified applicants (79% increase) with 37% of candidates being 
                      female (~3x increase) and 37% of candidates being under-represented minorities.

                <p>Above I discussed my opinions about effective email campaigns with the emphasis being about recruiting students 
                    would tell you a similar story.  So you must meet students early - through summer research programs (see REU), sophomores
                    them honestly what to expect.  These are the events that cause a student to select a program.  Every college sports coach 
                    interaction with a student that is indecisive about the decision.  Meeting the student, talking to them, telling 
                    interested know when and how to apply.  The foreshadowing of a successful recruitment plan starts with early 
                    but that is by far not the entire picture of recruitment.  It is actually the end game - it lets people already 
                    at conferences, juniors within classes, and through responding to students immediately up their visit to your website.</p>
                <p>To add this personal touch, I added a form to the pages discussing graduate programs and graduate funding that collected the 
                    student's interests, graduation dates, and contact information so that we could immediately talk.  The contact information
                    was also collected at conferences and diversity events and through summer programs.  Each month I talked to at least a few 
                    interested students.  Ultimately, the faculty needed to determine who to select but I could get a more interested group to apply.

                <p>The Young Scholars Program (YSP) is a summer research program for high school students.  Each student is paired with
                    a graduate research assistant and complete a short 4-week research project.  An interesting aspect of this program
                    is that applications by female students outnumber the male applications since at least 2015.  If I remember correctly,
                    in 2016 female applicants made up more than 80% of all applications.  This is significant because electrical engineering
                    has traditionally averaged under 10% female students.

                    The annual Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program was not actually a research experience but better described
                    as a curriculum development experience.  For about four weeks, I assisted teachers in creating projects related to 
                    power and energy.  Originally, the setup of the program was a lot seminars about power and energy presented by 
                    graduate students.  The content was often too advanced and lacked clarity as to how the information related to 
                    the teacher's projects.  In the later years of the program, a more self-directed learning model was used.  In this case,
                    only a small number of seminars that directly related to understanding electricity were provided and all other knowledge
                    development occurred through readings, discussion with experts (via field trips), and guidance from myself.

                <p>Family Engineering Nights was an after-school program for mostly elementary students and sometimes middle school
                    students. The concept was to bring together school teachers and university students and have them enact short
                    hands-on activities in the schools gymnasium.  The goal was to have a fair-like environment so the kids could go
                    from activity-to-activity and utilize the engineering students technical knowledge and the teachers early childhood development
                    knowledge to aid each other.</p>
                <p>Overall, I believe that I modified about 20 activities and we had a portfolio of about 30 
                    activities we could use.  A typical event had 7-10 activities and had 200 to 300 participants.  Besides making the activities,
                    I also organized the planning meetings, the support staff training, the transportation of people and materials, the purchasing
                    of materials, the management of student workers constructing the materials, and the creation of all flyers, guides, and posters.

                    about 3 hours each day for three days.  Adventures in STEM (AiS) was an all female middle school camp that I administrated from 
                    advertising, to registration, to instructor selection, and all non-classroom aspects of the program. AiS goal was to promote
                    engineering to female students and the program was structured so that the instructors were female and the campers interviewed
                    female faculty and engineering students.

                <p>For several years I had been interested in developing a hands-on project using low voltage AC electricity.  I had
                    made several learning modules using DC electricity but they were always very simple since power conversion is
                    very limited with simple equipment.  An AC electricity project with transformers could represent many different
                    real-life events but there are issues surrounding a cost effective power source and safety.  All of this was
                    resolved when I found 2.5v AC adapters for $8 and 10:1 turns power transformers for $12.  With student workers
                    supervising each table, I was able to implement safely a power grid project where 9th grade students supplied their
                    system with 2.5v AC and transmitted the power at 24v AC and reduced back to a usable 2.5v AC to power lights.  The
                    students also used relays representing substation switches in their development of a mini-grid.
                </p>
                <p>This project was part of a 2.5 hour activity period that was held four times over the course of two days.  About
                    100 students worked on the power grid project.  I also organized a panel discussion for parents to interview
                    undergraduate engineering students about their college experiences and I  presented a seminar about how to 
                    develop collaborative relationships with universities and industry to increase real world connections.

                <p>In early 2014, I was asked to design a booth with interactive activities for the 2014 Science and Engineering Festival 
                    held in Washington DC.  The festival was expected to have over 250,000 visitors and ended up having over 325,000 visitors.
                    So with less than three months to spare and a budget less than $8,000, I needed to decide how I could provide a learning
                    module that is entertaining, STEM related, takes less than 3 minutes to complete, and required few consumable materials.  On
                    top of these requirements, the event occurred 14 days before the NSF/DOE</p>
                <p>I decided that I would modify two activities students had enjoyed previously - solar car racing and circuits kits.  I would 
                    also use a plasma ball but unaltered.</p>
                <p><img class="myImg imgr thumb borderedbox inspace-5" src="https://ejwills.bitbucket.io/images/projects/sefest.jpg" alt="Solar Car Racing Activity">The original solar car activity had students with lamps following the cars on the ground.
                    It was an activity for small children which made it even more chaotic and not a good activity for a convention center.  So to contain
                    the activity, a frame was created that could sit on a standard 6' table with two lamps hanging from the upper frame.  Additional 
                    controls were also added with a push button power cord and lamps without off options.  This addition allowed for the lamps to 
                    be turned on and off simultaneously.</p>
                <p><img class="myImg imgl thumb borderedbox inspace-5" src="https://ejwills.bitbucket.io/images/projects/sefest2.jpg" alt="Freestanding Circuit Boards">The circuit kits have many loose parts and require a lot of explanation by a mentor.  To make the kit durable, the kit components -
                    light bulbs, switches, pushbuttons, variable resistors - were mounted on plastic boards that are freestanding on tables.  The only
                    not attached parts were the wires used to make the circuits.  Powered with a 12 volt DC or less power adapters, a total of three
                    boards were made each teaching a different concept about circuits.</p>
                <p>The activities worked well for the three day event and we saw over 2,500 people.  I found a graduate student in electrical engineering
                    that was available and four intern teachers who I trained to be able to explain and officiate each activity.  After negotiating
                    hotel rates and scheduling flights for half the helpers and driving the materials to DC in a van, we finished the event $100 below
                    budget.  Not bad for a 3 day stay in Washington, DC. <b>Note</b>:  The activities had been used at other events totaling
                    close to 6,000 students and only had small repairs needed.

                <p>I think LinkedIn is useful, but I don't like the limits placed on the layouts of their profiles.  Hence, I decided 
                    to create this simple profile site because it would only take a short amount of time since I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    Plus, I am already using Git/Gitbucket.

                <p>I have too many files and need a better way of organizing them.  That is why I started customizing a WordPress 
                    template (PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS) that will help me distribute materials while also having features for documenting personnel and events.

                <p>As more industry members joined the research center, the need for being able to distribute research papers grew.  I contributed 
                    to this effort by organizing several people.  My student workers filled in an online spreadsheet with all the citation and hyperlink 
                    information after being given a list of over 500 publication titles.  The IT person imported the entries into the database 
                    and output a webpage with a simple table.  My part was to add in formatting (CSS) and add in Javascript that would provide the 
                    search capabilities.  In two hours, the list went from hyperlinks in a column to looking like the image to the right.

                <p>After several years of working with a data entry system, I determined that there were many reports, utilities, and 
                    processes that could be added into the data collection system to make it much more functional.  Since all the groups 
                    using the database could not agree on the changes and there was no on available to modify the Drupal CMS, I began 
                    recreating the database based on the data tables that could be modified out of the system.</p>
                <p>In the end, I was able to recreate all the data but it turned out my table organization was much more concise and 
                    easier to use. In the end, I created several reports to help estimate demographics changes per semester, tables 
                    to identify missing data, and wrote a method of including the student entrance and exit forms as part of the database system.

                    Semi-annually I reviewed the data I collected from about 23 faculty members and their students from 4 universities.  I collected a 
                    broad range of data including personnel information, internships, outreach, courses taught, and any new curricular
                    materials being published.  Information about the faculty's presentations,  publications, and patents were collected
                    by another person.</p>
                <p>At the end of the year, I would upload all this information into a data collection system which
                    produced a variety of tables and charts with current and previous years' data.  I also produced separate tables and
                    charts that better described the center's demographics, program progress, and impact on education.  The write-ups and data went into 
                    two sections and the appendix of the report, totaling over 110 pages of the 400 page report.

                <p>So how do you advertise to people with a very specific background?  General advertising online is not very cost effective for
                    this scenario.  Conferences can help concentrate some of the potential candidates.  Online professional organizations can be
                    somewhat effective if done wisely.
                </p>
                <p> The route I took was to develop email lists targeting the advisors and institutions where
                    I would find the best candidates.  My database used to reach college students had over 200 department heads, 70 advising staff,
                    50 recently awarded scholarship recipients, 30 former program participants, and 10 social media accounts of student organizations.
                    I also developed similar lists for industry and pre-college outreach (local schools).

                    classroom and on the job, modifying recipes, modifying the programming logic, evaluating equipment, troubleshooting

                    days off when I needed rest.  By the end of the project I was working only 60 hours per week.
